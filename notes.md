package managers – enabling the management of libraries (containing ready-made solutions that we can use in our programs) or components of the development environment (e.g. npm or yarn)
task runners and module bundlers – used, in simple terms, to automate the process of software development and merge the resulting code from many files and libraries (e.g. Grunt or Webpack)
testing framework – allows for automatic testing of the correctness of our program in search of potential errors (e.g. Mocha, Jasmine, or Jest)
security analyzers – as you can guess, used to control the security of our solution (e.g. Snyk, RetireJS, or OWASP Dependency Check)
