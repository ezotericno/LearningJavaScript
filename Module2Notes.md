# Module 2: Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, and Comments

### Variables
```var``` , ```let```

-  let prevents us from declaring another variable with the same name
-  Using ```var``` allows you to re-declare a variable, which can potentially lead to errors in the program execution
-  to assign a veriable we use the ```=``` operator
-  ```"use strict";``` forces interpreter to use modern JS standards
-  ```
   let  steps  =  100;
    console.log(steps);  //  ->  100
    steps  =  120;  //  ->  120
    console.log(steps);
    steps  =  steps  +  200;
    console.log(steps);  //  ->  320
   ```
  We can change variables using the method above

### Data Types
- the main types are number and character string

### Constants
- The ```const``` keyword is used to declare containers similar to variables
- this type of container is simultaneously declared and initialized
